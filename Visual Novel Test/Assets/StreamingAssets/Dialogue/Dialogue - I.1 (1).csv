"I mean, I know why I’m here; I’m desperate.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
I just don’t know how I got the courage to actually come here.,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"They had posters advertised throughout the metro line, and I think I heard a few ads on Spotify.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
“Test subjects required for University sleep experiment. $5000 compensation for each participant.”,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"Their website seemed pretty legitimate. It had all the info regarding the experiment, how long it would take, and even advertised that they would offer leave-of-absence proof for both work and school.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
How could I say no?,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"Shutting off Google Maps, I pocket my phone and cross the busy street, stepping into the imposing building.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
The lobby of the building indicates that I need to head to the fifth floor to get to the office.,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"I call the elevator down, wait for its doors to open, and ride up.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"As the doors slide open, I’m greeted with a very plain looking reception area, advertising the University’s logo on one of the walls nearby.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
I step up to the secretary sitting at the desk ahead of me.,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"Excuse me, I have an appointment at 12:30?",Player,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
It comes out as more of a question; almost as if I don’t believe I’m on file.,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"The receptionist types at her keyboard, clicks a few times, and brightens up when she finds what I presume to be my information.",,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
Yes! 12:30 appointment for PLAYER NAME. You’re right on time!,Secretary,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
If I could just have you fill out this form before meeting with our resident doctor for a quick check up?,Secretary,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,
"She produces a clipboard with a few sheets of paper clipped and a pen. I nod, grab it, and find a seat nearby.",,,,,,,,,,
I fill it out quietly; not like there’s anyone to talk to anyway.,,,,,,,,,,
"It’s your usual health information questions such as medical history, past or current medication.",,,,,,,,,,
"There’s also a section regarding your sleep schedule, and finally a contact information sheet in case of an emergency. I sign at the bottom of it.",,,,,,,,,,
"Once I’m done, I head back to the reception desk and slide the clipboard along it towards the secretary.",,,,,,,,,,
"I, uh, finished.",Player,,,,,,,,,
"She grabs it, adds her own signature after glossing over it, and stands.",,,,,,,,,,
"If you’ll follow me, please.",Secretary,,,,,,,,,
She doesn’t wait for me to confirm that I will. I have to walk a little faster to catch up to her.,,,,,,,,,,
We head down a hallway to the door at its furthest end. She places the clipboard in a cubby hole next to what I assume is the office.,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Tremblay will see you in a moment. Just step inside and make yourself comfortable.,Secretary,,,,,,,,,
I notice that she pronounces the French name with an accent.,,,,,,,,,,
Thank you.,Player,,,,,,,,,
"She smiles and walks back down the hallway, her heels clopping on the carpeted floor.",,,,,,,,,,
I step into the office.,,,,,,,,,,
…,,,,,,,,,,
I don’t know what else I was expecting.,,,,,,,,,,
I sit on the chair opposite of the doctor’s desk.,,,,,,,,,,
"No sooner than I do, the door opens and a woman in a white lab coat enters.",,,,,,,,,,
Good afternoon…,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
She looks at the clipboard in her hand.,,,,,,,,,,
… PLAYER NAME. How are you?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
"I’m feeling alright, yourself?",Player,,,,,,,,,
"She doesn’t answer, instead going over the information I put in. She ends up walking across the room to sit at her desk, placing the clipboard on it.",,,,,,,,,,
"Before we begin, I’d like to thank you for signing up for this trial. I understand that you have personal lives you’d rather be attending to.",Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I shrug.,,,,,,,,,,
I’m not particularly busy and I could use the money.,Player,,,,,,,,,
She gives a forced smile.,,,,,,,,,,
Of course.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
She looks back down at my information.,,,,,,,,,,
It says here that you’re a student. What are you studying?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
Biology.,Player,,,,,,,,,
Any in particular?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
A bit of everything; I’m not quite sure yet what to specify in.,Player,,,,,,,,,
She nods and looks over the rest of my information.,,,,,,,,,,
Have you informed anyone that you were coming here?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I blink.,,,,,,,,,,
"Uh, my employer and my parents, yes.",Player,,,,,,,,,
She nods again and pushes the clipboard aside. She then reaches over to a water cooler next to her and pours some into a paper cup.,,,,,,,,,,
"She slides the cup across the desk and, without even thinking about it, I grab it with a quiet “thank you” and take a few sips.",,,,,,,,,,
Speaking to strangers always leaves me with cottonmouth.,,,,,,,,,,
I’m mid-sip when she speaks again.,,,,,,,,,,
Tell me about your sleeping habits.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I swallow and laugh.,,,,,,,,,,
I’m a college student in biology; my sleep is almost non-existent.,Player,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Tremblay gives a genuine smile this time.,,,,,,,,,,
You wrote here that you get on average three to five hours of sleep a day?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I nod.,,,,,,,,,,
I have a bad habit of scrolling on my phone before going to sleep. That can usually last a couple of hours.,Player,,,,,,,,,
That was going to be my next question. Are you aware that blue-light screens can affect sleeping patterns?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
"Yeah, I know it’s bad. Just can’t help it.",Player,,,,,,,,,
"No worries, just understand that during the experiment you will have limited contact with blue-light screens such as computers, laptops, tablets, and your personal cell phone.",Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I start getting a little nervous.,,,,,,,,,,
You’ll be taking my phone away?,Player,,,,,,,,,
Only temporarily. It will be returned to you at certain times of the day.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I relax a bit.,,,,,,,,,,
"Ok, just so long as nothing happens to it.",Player,,,,,,,,,
Of course.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I finish the cup of water and place it on her desk. She smiles and stands.,,,,,,,,,,
"Now, I’ll be performing a routine physical just to confirm that you are in health.",Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
Ok.,Player,,,,,,,,,
If you could sit on the table over here.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I stand and do so.,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Tremblay starts by flashing a light into my eyes. She then rubs just underneath my jaw, checking my glands, and pulls out the cuff to measure blood pressure with.",,,,,,,,,,
"It’s uncomfortable when it tightens around my arm, but it quickly deflates; my blood flows a bit faster and harder there.",,,,,,,,,,
If you could lay down for me.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
I do so. I have to stifle a yawn; laying down always gets me sleepy.,,,,,,,,,,
"She knocks in a peculiar manner at my ribs, and then applies pressure to different areas of my stomach. Finally, she checks the circulation in my ankles and nods.",,,,,,,,,,
"Perfect. You can stand up now, I’ll weigh and measure you.",Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
"A little sluggish, I sit up and hop off the table, toe my shoes off, and take out both my phone and wallet from my pockets before placing them on her desk.",,,,,,,,,,
I step on the scale and cringe a little at the number displayed. Really gotta stop snacking at midnight…,,,,,,,,,,
It’s as I get off that I suddenly feel very tired. More so than usual.,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Tremblay seems to notice my disposition and she frowns.,,,,,,,,,,
Is everything alright?,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
"Yes, I-",Player,,,,,,,,,
I try to take a step towards the chair and my knee buckles. I suddenly feel very weak in all my limbs.,,,,,,,,,,
"Panic starts to course through my veins, which allows me to open my eyes for a little bit. I realize I’m slurring as I speak.",,,,,,,,,,
I don’t… feel well.,Player,,,,,,,,,
"I feel Dr. Tremblay guide my body towards the chair, where I immediately slump in.",,,,,,,,,,
I force myself to look over at her. The doctor is impassive to my state-of-being.,,,,,,,,,,
Wha…,Player,,,,,,,,,
Took you longer than most.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,,,
"I can feel my heart race as she says that, but I’m just so tired.",,,,,,,,,,
"I try to stand up, but my arms shake as they try to push myself up.",,,,,,,,,,
A low groaning sound leaves my throat and the last thing I see is Dr. Tremblay taking my wallet and phone and pocketing them in her coat.,,,,,,,,,,
Good night.,Dr. Tremblay,,,,,,,TRUE,,
